*When individuals change, teams change. Team timelines reveal that these changes follow laws.*

## Previously

In [Chapter 5](https://dev.to/machuz/git-archaeology-5-timeline-scores-dont-lie-and-they-capture-hesitation-too-1gi5), I used `eis timeline` to trace individual timelines — Engineer F's departure and machuz's rise, Engineer I's "hesitation" and return.

But those were individual stories. **A team is a collection of individuals.** When individuals change, the team's nature changes too.

`eis timeline` also auto-generates team-level aggregations. This chapter reads those team timelines, then extracts the **laws of engineer evolution** visible in the data.

---

## Team Timeline: What It Shows

The team timeline classifies the entire team for each period:

- **Character** — Team personality (Elite, Guardian, Factory, Balanced, Explorer, Firefighting)
- **Structure** — Organization (Architectural Engine, Delivery Team, Maintenance Team, Unstructured)
- **Culture** — Culture (Builder, Stability, Exploration, Firefighting)
- **Phase** — Phase (Mature, Emerging, Declining)
- **Risk** — Risk (Healthy, Design Vacuum, Quality Drift)

Plus Health metrics (Complementarity, Growth Potential, Sustainability, etc.) and Score Averages per period.

**Individual Role/Style changes surface as team Character/Structure changes.** That's the insight.

---

## Real Data: The Backend Team's Transformation

```
═══ Backend — Team Timeline ═══

Classification:
  Period            2024-H2         2026-H1
  Character         Balanced        Elite
  Structure         Unstructured    Architectural Engine
  Culture           Stability       Builder
  Phase             Declining       Mature
  Risk              Design Vacuum   Healthy
```

(2024-H2 through 2025-H2 lack classification due to insufficient member count. Comparing 2024-H2 and 2026-H1.)

**Balanced → Elite. Unstructured → Architectural Engine. Declining → Mature. Design Vacuum → Healthy.**

Every axis improved.

Why? As Chapter 5 showed:

- **2024**: Engineer F sustained the structure as Architect Builder
- **2025-H1**: Engineer F declined from Anchor → Fragile. No structure owner
- **2025-H2**: machuz reached Architect Builder
- **2026-H1**: Team reached Elite / Architectural Engine / Mature / Healthy

**A generational transition at the individual level manifested as a team-level transformation.**

Engineer F's departure temporarily created a Design Vacuum. But machuz inherited the Architect role, new members joined, and the team reached a healthier state than before.

Looking at Score Averages:

```
Score Averages:
  Period            2024-H2         2026-H1
  Production        0.0             57.7
  Quality           0.0             64.6
  Survival          0.0             39.2
  Design            0.0             36.4
  Total             0.0             48.3
```

Design at 36.4 is still low. Because Architect responsibility is concentrated in machuz alone. Other members' Design scores are mostly 0–30.

**The Elite team's next challenge: distributing design capability.**

---

## Real Data: The Frontend Team's Evolution

Frontend has longer data coverage, making transitions easier to read.

```
═══ Frontend — Team Timeline ═══

Classification:
  Period            2024-H2         2025-H1         2025-H2         2026-H1
  Character         Guardian        Factory         Guardian        Balanced
  Structure         Maintenance     Delivery        Maintenance     Maintenance
  Culture           Stability       Stability       Stability       Builder
  Phase             Declining       Declining       Declining       Mature
  Risk              Quality Drift   Quality Drift   Quality Drift   Design Vacuum
```

First thing that stands out: **Declining → Mature only happened in 2026-H1.** Later than Backend.

Then **Culture: Stability → Builder**. This is largely Engineer I's influence (Architect from day one, as covered in Chapter 5). Engineer I's continuous involvement in design files shifted team culture from Stability (defensive) to Builder (offensive).

Meanwhile, Risk shifted from **Quality Drift → Design Vacuum**. This looks like a deterioration, but the meaning is different:

- **Quality Drift**: Quality varies across members (many Producers)
- **Design Vacuum**: Designers are scarce (Architect departed or absent)

Engineer J settled into Producer in 2025-H2, and Engineer I sometimes oscillates to Anchor. **There aren't always two Architects simultaneously**, hence the Design Vacuum risk.

One more interesting pattern in Frontend:

```
Transitions:
  [2025-H1] Character: Guardian → Factory
  [2025-H1] Structure: Maintenance Team → Delivery Team
  [2025-H2] Character: Factory → Guardian
  [2025-H2] Structure: Delivery Team → Maintenance Team
```

**In 2025-H1, the team briefly became Factory / Delivery Team, then reverted.**

What happened? 2025-H1 was when Engineer I hit peak score (87.5) as Architect Builder. Engineer J was simultaneously Anchor Emergent. **Both designer and producer were at high output.** The team temporarily exhibited Factory (high-throughput) / Delivery Team characteristics.

But that "maximum output" was temporary. The next half, it reverted to Guardian / Maintenance.

**Team character fluctuates with individual output on a quarterly basis.** The smaller the team, the more pronounced this effect.

---

## Cross-Domain: Infra and Firmware

### Infra: Explorer / Emerging

```
Classification (2026-H1):
  Character         Explorer
  Structure         Balanced
  Culture           Exploration
  Phase             Emerging
  Risk              Design Vacuum
```

Explorer / Exploration / Emerging. **A team still taking shape.**

Every member scores as Growing or Spread. Zero Architects. Design Vacuum is inevitable.

But Phase: Emerging means **growth is happening**. Not Declining.

### Firmware: Firefighting

```
Classification (2026-H1):
  Character         Firefighting
  Structure         Maintenance Team
  Culture           Firefighting
  Phase             Declining
  Risk              Design Vacuum
```

Firmware has only two members. Character: Firefighting. Culture: Firefighting.

Production 100, Quality 84.6. **Productive, but no design.**

This is a team "responding to problems as they arise." No bandwidth to build structure. No Architect, Design at 0.

**The smaller the team, the more a single person's entry or exit fundamentally changes the team's nature.** If one Architect joined Firmware, it would shift from Firefighting to Builder.

---

## Now the Main Event: Evolution Models

When you lay individual timelines alongside team timelines, **laws** emerge.

Who evolves how, under what conditions do Roles change, and how does it affect the team?

Here are the evolution models extracted from our timeline data.

---

### Model 1: There's More Than One Path to Architect

machuz's Backend timeline:

```
2024-H1     27.6  Anchor  —        Growing
2024-H2     76.4  Anchor  Builder
2025-H1     58.4  Producer Balanced
2025-H2     92.5  Architect Builder
2026-H1     92.4  Architect Builder  Active
```

**Anchor → Producer → Architect.**

A classic "staircase" evolution. First understand structure as Anchor, then prove production capability as Producer, then finally design structure as Architect.

Meanwhile, Engineer I's Frontend timeline (from Chapter 5):

```
2024-Q3     56.1  Anchor   Balanced
2024-Q4     75.7  Architect Balanced
```

**Architect by their second quarter.** Skipping the stairs entirely.

This is the "someone who already had Architect capability externally" pattern. Only one quarter of Anchor (learning the existing structure), then immediately operating as Architect.

**There are at least two evolution paths:**

1. **Climbing type** — Anchor → Producer → Architect (machuz's path)
2. **Ready-made type** — Anchor (brief) → Architect (Engineer I's path)

The climbing type takes longer but develops deep contextual understanding before reaching Architect. The ready-made type is fast but carries **collision risk with the team**, as Chapter 5 showed.

---

### Model 2: Backend Architects Concentrate, Frontend Architects Flow

Touched on in Chapter 5, but timelines make it clearer.

**Backend:**

```
2024-H1   Engineer F  93.5  Architect Builder    machuz  27.6  Anchor
2024-H2   Engineer F  84.1  Architect Builder    machuz  76.4  Anchor Builder
2025-H1   Engineer F  72.7  Anchor Balanced      machuz  58.4  Producer
2025-H2   Engineer F  37.5  Anchor               machuz  92.5  Architect Builder
```

As an observation, **there was never a period with two simultaneous Architects.** Engineer F stepped down before machuz stepped up. Whether this reflects a structural constraint of Backend's single design axis (one DB schema, one API convention) or simply machuz's growth timing is hard to determine from this sample alone. But at minimum, BE Architects tend to concentrate.

**Frontend:**

```
2024-H2   Engineer I  72.7  Anchor       Engineer J  74.9  Architect Builder
2025-H1   Engineer I  83.8  Architect    Engineer J  54.3  Anchor
2025-H2   Engineer I  85.1  Architect    Engineer J  38.6  Anchor
```

In Frontend, when Engineer I became Architect, Engineer J dropped to Anchor. **At first glance, it looks like the same "one seat" pattern.**

But quarterly data (Chapter 5) reveals:

```
2025-Q2   Engineer I  73.2  Architect    Engineer J  63.8  Architect
```

**In 2025-Q2, two Architects existed simultaneously.**

A phenomenon not observed in Backend happened in Frontend.

The hypothesis: **Backend shares a single structure.** Database schema, API design conventions, shared libraries. Design decisions converge on a single axis, so Architects tend to concentrate.

**Frontend supports parallel structures.** Component design, state management, routing. Independent design decisions are possible in each domain, allowing multiple Architects to coexist.

That said, Backend's "one at a time" pattern could be a sample size limitation. With a larger team, multiple Backend Architects might coexist.

The **Design Vacuum risk** in Frontend's team timeline is the flip side of this fluidity. Even if multiple Architects are possible, they aren't always present simultaneously. The moment one transitions to Producer, Design Vacuum appears.

---

### Model 3: Producer Is Metabolism

Look at Engineer J's transitions again:

```
Architect → Anchor → Architect → Producer → Producer → Producer
```

**An Architect who finishes building structure becomes a Producer.**

This isn't regression. **It's metabolism.**

An Architect builds structure. The structure is complete. Then the Architect's work diminishes. Changes to design files become unnecessary, Design score drops, and Role naturally shifts to Producer.

Then they enter a phase of "producing on top of the structure."

The same pattern can be predicted for machuz's Backend. Currently maintaining 92 as Architect Builder, but once the structure stabilizes, machuz will likely transition to Producer too. **When that time comes, the next Architect will be needed.**

This is where Backend's team Health metric becomes meaningful:

```
Growth Potential: 20.0
```

Growth Potential at 20. **The seeds of the next-generation Architect are still weak.** This is Backend's medium-term risk.

---

### Model 4: The Founding Architect Lifecycle

In the Frontend 6-month timeline, one engineer has a uniquely dramatic trajectory.

```
--- Engineer K (Frontend) ---
2024-H1     87.8  Architect Builder
2024-H2     14.6  — —
2025-H1      7.1  — — Silent
2025-H2      3.2  — —
2026-H1      3.2  — —
```

**Total 87.8 in 2024-H1. Architect Builder.** Production 81, Survival 100, Design 100.

The next half: Total 14.6. After that, effectively zero.

This is the **founding Architect lifecycle**.

Engineer K built Frontend's initial structure. In 2024-H1, the codebase's blame was dominated by Engineer K. Architect Builder was the natural result.

But as the team grew and other engineers (Engineer I, Engineer J) joined and began rewriting the structure, Engineer K's Survival dropped rapidly. Blame lines were replaced by other members.

**A founding Architect's score drops as the team grows.**

This isn't failure. It's **proof of success.** Other engineers are building on top of the structure you created alone. That's why the score drops.

```
Engineer K:  87.8 → 14.6 → 7.1 → 3.2 → 3.2
Engineer I:   — → 72.7 → 83.8 → 85.1 → 78.1
Engineer J:  25.9 → 74.9 → 54.3 → 38.6 → 54.2
```

**Engineer K's score transferred to Engineers I and J.** The total isn't conserved, but the generational transfer of structural influence is clear.

This is a different kind of "exit" from Engineer F's departure (Chapter 5). Engineer F exited due to **team departure**. Engineer K exited due to **team growth**.

EIS captures both.

---

### Model 5: Builder Is a Prerequisite for Architect

Timeline data shows that **reaching Architect almost always requires passing through Builder**:

```
machuz:     Anchor → Anchor Builder → Producer Balanced → Architect Builder
Engineer I: Anchor Balanced → Architect Balanced → Architect Builder
Engineer J: Anchor Growing → Architect Balanced → Architect Builder
Engineer F: (first appearance) Architect Builder
```

machuz passed through Anchor Builder before reaching Architect. Engineer I went Architect Balanced → Architect Builder. Engineer J also went Architect Balanced → Architect Builder.

**Engineers who can't become Builders don't become Architects.**

What is a Builder? An engineer who writes new code that survives. Not modifying existing code (Balanced), but adding new structure.

This aligns with the essence of "designing." Design isn't "modifying what exists" — it's "creating new structure."

It's no coincidence that the moment Frontend's Culture shifted from Stability → Builder in the team timeline, the Phase changed from Declining → Mature.

**Teams without Builder culture can't mature.** Defense alone leads to decline.

---

### Model 6: Producer Vacuum

What happens when a team has no Producers?

Look at Backend 2024-H2. machuz as Anchor Builder (76.4), Engineer F as Architect Builder (84.1). But zero Producers.

That period's team classification:

```
Character: Balanced
Phase: Declining
```

**The Architect builds structure, the Anchor maintains it. But nobody is producing on top of that structure.**

Structure without production. That's Producer Vacuum.

Compare with Backend 2026-H1:

```
Effective Members: 5
Total: 48.3 (average)
```

machuz (Architect Builder) plus multiple Anchors/Producers. People producing on top of the structure. That's why it reached Elite / Architectural Engine.

**Architects alone can't make a team function.** You need Producers who use the structure the Architect built. Only then does the team work.

---

### Model 7: Producer Experience Fuels the Next Architect

Look at machuz's evolution one more time:

```
2024-H2     76.4  Anchor  Builder
2025-H1     58.4  Producer Balanced
2025-H2     92.5  Architect Builder
```

**Architect was reached after passing through a Producer phase in 2025-H1.**

What does the Producer phase mean? "Producing in volume on top of the structure." By using the existing structure extensively, you **internalize both its limitations and its possibilities**.

When machuz hit 92.5 as Architect Builder in 2025-H2, they entered design mode having intimately understood the structure they'd been producing on — including what needed improvement.

That's why Design hit 100. Design changes backed by deep structural understanding hit their mark. That's why Survival hit 100.

**Becoming Architect without Producer experience risks "armchair design."** Without experience using the structure, you build structures that are hard to use.

Engineer I could become Architect immediately after joining because, we can infer, **they had extensive Producer experience at their previous position.** They had used structures extensively elsewhere. That's why they could quickly identify "what needs to be designed" in a new environment.

---

## The Big Picture

Here are the evolution models extracted from timelines:

│  Producer fuel: using structure deeply powers design      │
│  Producer Vacuum: no producers = structure sits idle      │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

These laws were inductively derived from our team's real data. Whether the same laws hold for other teams is unknown.

But with `eis timeline`, **you can discover your own team's laws yourself.**

---

## Using Team Timelines

### 1. Organizational Review

```bash
eis timeline --span 6m --periods 0 --recursive ~/workspace
```

Generate half-year team timelines and track Phase / Risk trends. If Declining persists, something needs to change.

### 2. Architect Planning

When a team has no Architect (Design Vacuum), use timelines to identify who could become one:

- Do they have Builder experience?
- Have they been through a Producer phase?
- Have they understood the structure as an Anchor?

### 3. Detecting Producer Vacuum

If a team has an Architect but isn't functioning, suspect Producer Vacuum. Structure exists but nobody's producing on it. Check individual timelines — if Producers are absent, reassess resource allocation.

### 4. Evaluating Founding Architects Correctly

If you find a founding member whose scores are declining, **determine whether it's failure or success.** Score decline due to team growth should be recognized as an achievement, not a problem.

---

## What This Discovery Means

Chapter 5 gained the time axis. Chapter 6 **gained laws**.

Snapshots show "now." Timelines show "change." Laws predict "what happens next."

- When machuz transitions to Producer, the next Architect will be needed
- If Frontend's Design Vacuum persists, either wait for Engineer I's Architect return or develop a new Architect
- For Infra to progress from Emerging → Mature, it needs Builders first

**Deriving laws from cold numbers, then reading the future from those laws.** That's the true power of the timeline.
