*Departed Architects leave souls in the codebase. Laying them to rest is sacred work.*

## Previously

In [Chapter 3](https://dev.to/machuz/two-paths-to-architect-how-engineers-evolve-differently-xxxx), I explored a frontend team and discovered two evolution paths for Architects:

- **Inheritance Architect**: Anchor → guards and refines existing structure
- **Emergent Architect**: High-Gravity Producer → creates new gravitational fields

In frontend, multiple aesthetics of structure can coexist. This means multiple Architect candidates can emerge. **Structural competition** happens.

But when I ran EIS on a Backend team, I saw a completely different landscape.

---

## The Backend Team Portrait

Here's the Backend team's data:

```
#   Member     Active  Prod  Qual  Robust  Dormant  Design  Grav  Total  Role              Style             State
1   machuz     ✓       100   66    100     100      100     97    92.4   Architect (1.00)  Builder (1.00)    Active (0.80)
2   Engineer F —       93    75    36      21       47      76    55.5   Anchor (0.87)     Resilient (0.66)  Former (0.73)
3   Engineer G ✓       52    78    21      32       12      26    37.3   Anchor (0.96)     Balanced (0.30)   Active (0.80)
4   Engineer H ✓       49    90    20      25       10      31    35.6   Anchor (0.98)     Balanced (0.30)   Active (0.80)
```

And the team metrics:

```
═══ Backend (4 core + 3 risk / 12 total, 13 repos) ═══
  ★ Elite (1.00)

⚠ Warnings:
  43% risk ratio — 3 of 7 effective members are Former/Silent/Fragile
  Top contributor (machuz) accounts for 46% of core production
  ProdDensity drops to 39 without them

Classification:
  Structure: Emerging Architecture (0.66)
  Phase: Legacy-Heavy (0.67)
  Risk: Talent Drain (0.43)
```

The role distribution:

```
Role Distribution:
  Architect    █░░░░░░░░░  1 (14%)
  Anchor       ████░░░░░░  3 (43%)
  —            ████░░░░░░  3 (43%)
```

**1 Architect. 3 Anchors. 0 Producers.**

This is a completely different structure from frontend.

---

## Why Backend Architects Concentrate

In frontend, multiple Architects can emerge.

In backend, that rarely happens.

The reason is simple.

**Backend has "correct answers" for structure.**

For example, backend systems often have stable patterns like:

- Domain layer
- Application layer
- Repository layer
- Transaction boundaries
- Event boundaries

These design patterns have reusable structures across many systems.

In other words:

| FE | Multiple aesthetics of structure exist |
|---|---|
| BE | Correct answers tend to exist |

Because of this difference, **Backend Architects concentrate rather than proliferate**.

Think of it like a solar system:

```
Star (Architect)
    ↓
  Planets (Anchors)
    ↓
  Vacuum (No Producers)
```

This structure isn't unusual for Backend teams.

---

## The Soul of a Departed Architect

Look at Engineer F:

```
Engineer F  —  Prod 93 | Qual 75 | Robust 36 | Design 47 | Total 55.5
Role: Anchor (0.87) | Style: Resilient (0.66) | State: Former (0.73)
```

Engineer F is a **departed Architect**.

But even with time decay applied, **they're still ranked #2 on the team**.

What does this mean?

**The assets they created are still massively present in the codebase.**

---

### What Former State Means

In EIS, Former state is only detected **when significant assets remain**.

Former state conditions:

- Raw Survival (no time decay) is high
- Survival (with time decay) is low
- AND Design or Indispensability is high

This means: **"This person once shaped the structure. They're no longer active. But their code remains."**

You don't become Former just by leaving. **Only those who left assets worth leaving** become Former.

Engineer F meets exactly these conditions.

---

### Still #2 Despite Time Decay

This is the emotional part.

EIS uses **time-decayed Survival**. Code from 2 years ago has a weight of just 0.02.

And yet Engineer F is still #2.

This means **they continue to have massive influence on the codebase even after departure**.

This isn't "the afterimage of someone who was once strong."

**It's real assets that still support the codebase today.**

---

## Laying the Former to Rest

But Former state has another meaning.

**It's something that needs to be laid to rest.**

The team metrics show:

```
Phase: Legacy-Heavy (0.67)
Risk: Talent Drain (0.43)
```

Legacy-Heavy means **strong but historically heavy team**.

Departed members' code remains in large quantities. That's not inherently bad — good design is why it remains.

---

### Good Design Creates Common Sense

Here's an important fact.

**This team hasn't collapsed.**

Several modules that only Engineer F touched still exist. Most of git blame belongs to the Former member.

Yet the team functions normally.

Why?

**Because those modules were built under well-organized design.**

We received verbal handoffs. But complete documentation or knowledge transfer didn't happen. Still, **the design embedded as structure in the code gives later engineers a certain understanding**.

This is what I call "good design creates common sense."

Excellent design doesn't necessarily require complete documentation or knowledge transfer. **The structure of the code itself communicates the module's intent and usage.**

Strong design leaves knowledge in structure, not in people. And that structure creates shared understanding across the team.

---

### Legacy-Heavy Converges

EIS currently handles quantitative metrics like history and code survival rates. "Common sense through design" — why Former members' code still functions healthily — can't be directly observed yet.

If that became possible, we could distinguish between "structurally healthy despite heavy history" and "truly dangerous dependency structures."

But we may not need to measure that far.

**Strong teams gradually replace Former members' code with their own. Legacy-Heavy resolves over time. It converges toward the right state.**

EIS can naturally capture this convergence process through Survival trends and Risk Ratio changes.

---

However, as time passes, **the risk that fewer people understand that code** increases.

That's why laying the Former to rest becomes necessary.

---

### Souls Get Absorbed into Debt

What does laying a Former to rest mean?

It means **being absorbed into Debt Cleanup**.

```
Team Averages:
  Debt Cleanup   47.0
```

Active members touch Former's code. Understand it. Fix it. Rewrite it.

Then Former's blame lines decrease. They're replaced by active members' lines.

This is **laying to rest**.

EIS visualizes this process:

- Former's Survival gradually decreases
- Active members' Debt Cleanup increases
- Team's Legacy-Heavy degree decreases

**This is sacred work.**

The departed Architect's soul, through active members' hands, gradually dissolves into the codebase.

---

## The True Meaning of Anchor

This Backend team has 3 Anchors:

- Engineer F (Former)
- Engineer G
- Engineer H

Anchor isn't just "quality guardian."

**Anchor means structure-understanding engineer.**

Anchor traits:

- Deep understanding of existing structure
- Doesn't break structure
- Guards quality
- Maintains system integrity

In other words, Anchor is **an engineer who understands structure and produces on top of it**.

And in Backend, this Anchor becomes **the evolution path to Architect**.

---

## Backend Architect Evolution

In frontend:

```
Producer
↓
High-Gravity Producer
↓
Emergent Architect
```

But in Backend, this is more common:

```
Producer
↓
Anchor
↓
Inheritance Architect
```

This is the **Convergent Evolution Model**.

---

### The Reproducing Architect

Backend Architects are characterized by **being able to reproduce structure**.

Say a design like this worked in one codebase:

```
Domain + Application + Repository
```

A skilled Backend Architect can **reproduce that structure in a different system**.

So Backend Architect means:

- Someone who creates structure
- **AND someone who can reproduce structure**

If FE Architects are the type who "create emergent new structures," Backend Architects are the type who "**purify and reproduce structures**."

---

## Producer Vacuum

Another interesting point.

This team has **no Producers**.

```
Architect  1
Anchor     3
Producer   0
```

Producer means "someone who doesn't fully understand structure but produces on top of it."

Without Producers, team structure looks like:

```
Architect
↓
Anchor
↓
Production Vacuum
```

This is a state I'd call **Producer Vacuum**.

With Producers:

```
Architect
↓
Anchor
↓
Producer
```

A three-layer structure forms.

This is the most stable form for Backend teams.

---

## Architect Bus Factor = 1

EIS raises warnings for this team:

```
Top contributor (machuz) accounts for 46% of core production
ProdDensity drops to 39 without them
```

This means **Architect Bus Factor = 1**.

If the Architect leaves, team productivity density drops significantly.

This is the most typical risk for Backend teams.

In frontend, Emergent Architect candidates can mitigate this problem.

But in Backend, **because correct structural answers exist, Architects tend to concentrate**.

Result: Bus Factor risk increases.

---

## Prescription for This Team

What does this Backend team need?

1. **Fill the Producer layer**: Allow reverse flow from Anchor → Producer. Create an environment where people can produce without fully understanding structure
2. **Accelerate laying Former to rest**: Active members take over departed Architect's code. Consciously increase Debt Cleanup
3. **Open the Anchor → Architect path**: Let structure-understanding Anchors participate in design decisions

#2 is especially important.

Legacy-Heavy state isn't "bad." It's proof that **good design remains**.

But understanding it, taking it over, and rewriting when needed — **someone has to do that work**.

That work is visualized as Debt Cleanup.

---

## FE vs BE Evolution Models Compared

Summary:

| | FE | BE |
|---|---|---|
| Structure | Multiple aesthetics exist | Correct answers tend to exist |
| Architect | Can distribute | Tends to concentrate |
| Evolution Model | Branching (Emergent or Inheritance) | Convergent (Inheritance dominant) |
| Risk | Structural collision | Bus Factor concentration |

Neither is better.

**The nature of the domain determines the evolution model.**

EIS visualizes these differences and can suggest appropriate prescriptions for each.

---

## What This Discovery Means

Chapter 3 showed frontend's branching evolution model.

Chapter 4 showed backend's convergent evolution model.

And one more concept emerged: **laying the Former to rest**.

Departed Architects' souls remain in the codebase.

Active members take them over, understand them, rewrite them.

**That sacred work is visualized as Debt Cleanup.**

Cold numbers, it turns out, tell the most human stories.

That might be the essence of EIS.
