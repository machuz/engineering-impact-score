**A framework that measures real engineering impact using only Git history.**

It estimates who actually builds and sustains a system by combining production, survival, design, and maintenance signals. No surveys, no subjective reviews — just `git log` and `git blame`.

> In practice, this surfaced patterns that naive metrics miss: former architects, silent cleaners, debt generators, and bus-factor risks.

## Why This Matters

Most engineering metrics measure activity: commits, pull requests, and lines of code.

This project tries to measure something harder: who actually builds durable systems, shapes architecture, and keeps a codebase healthy over time.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install
go install github.com/machuz/engineering-impact-score/cmd/eis@latest
# or
brew tap machuz/tap && brew install eis

# Try it on your repo
eis analyze .
```

That's it. No AI tokens, no API keys, no cloud dependencies.

```bash
# Auto-discover repos under a directory
eis analyze --recursive ~/workspace

# With config (aliases, domain mapping, weights)
eis analyze --config eis.yaml --recursive ~/projects

# Export as JSON or CSV
eis analyze --format json --recursive ~/workspace > result.json
```

## How This Differs from Existing Metrics

| Framework | What it measures | Signal source | Individual? | Key limitation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **DORA** | Deployment speed & stability | CI/CD pipeline | No (team) | Doesn't measure code quality or individual impact |
| **SPACE** | 5 holistic dimensions | Surveys + tools | Both | Survey-heavy, 3-6 months to implement |
| **McKinsey** | Org productivity | DORA + SPACE + custom | Mixed | [Widely criticized](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/measuring-developer-productivity) for output theater |
| **LOC / Commits** | Activity volume | Git | Yes | Trivially gameable, penalizes refactoring |
| **Code Churn** | % of recent code rewritten | Git | No (team) | Arbitrary time window, context-blind |
| **Bus Factor** | Knowledge concentration risk | Git blame | No (team) | Only identifies risk, not impact |
| **Git analytics tools** (Pluralsight Flow, LinearB, etc.) | Activity & cycle time | Git + integrations | Both | Still activity-focused — measures *when*, not *whether it lasted* |
| **Engineering Impact Score** | **Code that survives over time** | **Git log + blame** | **Yes** | Accuracy depends on codebase design quality |

The core gap this model fills: **existing frameworks measure activity or velocity, not whether individual contributions actually lasted.** DORA tells you how fast code reaches production. This model tells you whether it was worth deploying.

Time-decayed survival is also naturally resistant to gaming — you can't inflate your score with busy work, because only code that remains in the codebase months later counts.

## The 7 Axes

| Axis | Weight | What it measures |
|---|---|---|
| **Production** | 15% | Changes per day (absolute: configurable `production_daily_ref`, default 1000) |
| **First-pass Quality** | 10% | Low fix/revert commit ratio |
| **Code Survival** | **25%** | Recency-weighted blame survival (tau=180 exponential decay) |
| **Design** | 20% | Commits to architecture files |
| **Breadth** | 10% | Number of repositories contributed to |
| **Debt Cleanup** | 15% | Ratio of others' debt cleaned vs. own debt generated |
| **Indispensability** | 5% | Modules where you own 80%+ of blame lines (Bus Factor) |

**Code Survival is the core thesis** — exponential time decay ensures "are you *still* writing durable designs?" matters most.

## Score Guide

| Score | Assessment | Approx. Hourly (JPY) | Approx. Total Comp (USD) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 80-100 | Irreplaceable core member | ¥12,000-20,000 | $250K-400K+ |
| 60-79 | Near-core | ¥9,000-15,000 | $180K-300K |
| **40-59** | **Senior equivalent (40+ is genuinely strong)** | **¥7,000-11,000** | **$140K-220K** |
| 30-39 | Mid-level | ¥6,000-9,000 | $100K-160K |
| 20-29 | Junior-Mid | ¥5,000-8,000 | $80K-120K |
| -19 | Junior | ¥3,500-6,000 | $60K-90K |

USD figures are rough estimates and vary significantly by market (SF vs. Midwest, US vs. Europe, etc.).

**40 = Senior.** This metric is deliberately harsh. Scoring 40+ across 7 relative axes requires serious, well-rounded ability.

## Engineer Topology (3-Axis Classification)

Instead of a single archetype label, EIS v0.9+ classifies each engineer along 3 independent axes. This gives a richer, more composable picture than a flat type.

### Role — what they contribute

| Role | Key Signals | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Architect** | Design↑ RobustSurv↑ Breadth○ | Shapes system design with durable code under change pressure |
| **Anchor** | Qual↑ notLow(Prod) | Reliable quality contributor, not yet shaping architecture |
| **Cleaner** | Qual↑ Surv↑ Debt↑ | High quality, durable code, actively cleans others' debt |
| **Producer** | notLow(Prod) | Meaningful production output |
| **Specialist** | Surv↑ Breadth↓ | Deep in narrow area, high survival but low breadth |
| **—** | | No dominant role signal |

### Style — how they contribute

| Style | Key Signals | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Builder** | Prod↑ Design↑ Debt○ | Designs, builds heavily, AND cleans up — the full package |
| **Resilient** | Prod↑ Surv↓ RobustSurv○ | Iterates heavily but what survives under pressure is durable |
| **Rescue** | Prod↑ Surv↓ Debt↑ | Takes over and rewrites inherited legacy code |
| **Churn** | Prod↑ Qual↓ Surv↓ gap≥30 | Constant rework — most commits are fixes or reverts |
| **Mass** | Prod↑ Surv↓ | High output but code doesn't survive |
| **Balanced** | Total≥30 | Steady contributor, no dominant pattern |
| **Spread** | Breadth↑ Prod↓ Surv↓ Design↓ | Wide presence, shallow depth everywhere |
| **—** | | No dominant style signal |

### State — lifecycle phase

| State | Key Signals | Risk |
|---|---|---|
| **Active** | Recent commits | — |
| **Growing** | Prod↓ Qual↑ | — |
| **Former** | RawSurv↑ Surv↓ Design/Indisp↑ | **⚠️ Handoff** |
| **Silent** | Prod↓ Surv↓ Debt↓ (≥100 commits) | **High** |
| **Fragile** | Surv↑ Prod↓ Qual<70 | **⚠️ Hidden** |
| **—** | | No dominant state signal |

### Reading the output

Each engineer gets a 3-label profile. Examples:

| Profile | Interpretation |
|---|---|
| Architect / Builder / Active | Core contributor: designs, builds, cleans, currently active |
| Producer / Mass / — | High output but code doesn't last |
| — / Spread / Silent | Wide but shallow, not contributing meaningfully |
| Anchor / Balanced / Growing | Reliable quality, steady pace, improving |
| — / — / Fragile | Code survives only due to low change pressure |

**Churn, Mass, and Spread styles look productive on individual metrics** but score low overall. Only multi-axis evaluation exposes them.

## Key Formulas

### Recency-Weighted Survival (Core)

```python
import math
from collections import defaultdict

tau = 180  # days — weight ≈ 0.37 at 6 months

weighted_survival = defaultdict(float)
for line in blame_lines:
    days_alive = (now - line.committer_time).days
    weight = math.exp(-days_alive / tau)
    weighted_survival[line.author] += weight
```

### Debt Cleanup Ratio

```python
for fix_commit in fix_commits:
    fixer = fix_commit.author
    for changed_line in fix_commit.changed_lines:
        original_author = git_blame(file, at=parent_commit)
        if original_author != fixer:
            debt_generated[original_author] += 1
            debt_cleaned[fixer] += 1

debt_ratio = debt_cleaned / max(debt_generated, 1)
# > 1 = Cleaner   |   < 1 = Debt creator
```

### Indispensability (Bus Factor)

```python
for module in all_modules:
    top_share = max(blame_distribution[module].values()) / total
    if top_share >= 0.8:
        critical_modules[top_author].append(module)   # CRITICAL
    elif top_share >= 0.6:
        high_risk_modules[top_author].append(module)   # HIGH

indispensability = critical_count * 1.0 + high_count * 0.5
```

### Normalization & Total Score

```python
# Absolute axes (cross-org comparable):
#   Production: min(changes_per_day / production_daily_ref * 100, 100)
#   Quality: 100 - fix_ratio (already 0-100)
#   Debt: bounded 0-100 scale

# Relative axes (normalized within domain):
#   Survival, Design, Breadth, Indispensability

# Scored per domain (Backend/Frontend/Infra/Firmware separately)
total = (
    norm_production * 0.15
    + norm_quality * 0.10
    + norm_survival * 0.25
    + norm_design * 0.20
    + norm_breadth * 0.10
    + norm_debt_cleanup * 0.15
    + norm_indispensability * 0.05
)
```

## Design Principles

- **BE / FE / Infra / Firmware are scored separately** — mixing them contaminates rankings; auto-detected from file extensions or configured explicitly
- **Hybrid scoring** — Production, Quality, and Debt use absolute scales (cross-org comparable); Survival, Design, Breadth, and Indispensability use relative normalization within domain
- **Debt threshold** — members with fewer than 10 debt events get a neutral score (50) to avoid extreme ratios
- **Accuracy scales with codebase design quality** — well-structured codebases (Clean Architecture, DDD) yield more meaningful scores. If the score doesn't match gut feeling, it may signal poor codebase structure rather than a metric problem

## CLI Options

```
eis analyze [flags] [path...]

Flags:
  --config <path>     Config file (default: eis.yaml)
  --recursive         Recursively find git repos under given paths
  --depth <n>         Max directory depth for recursive search (default: 2)
  --format <fmt>      Output format: table, csv, json (default: table)
  --tau <days>        Survival decay parameter (default: 180)
  --sample <n>        Max files to blame per repo (default: 500)
  --workers <n>       Concurrent blame workers (default: 4)
  --domain <name>     Only analyze repos in this domain (e.g. Backend, Frontend, Firmware)
  --active-days <n>   Days to consider author active (default: 30)
  --pressure-mode     Change pressure mode: include (default) or ignore
```

## Configuration

See [`config.example.yaml`](config.example.yaml) for all options:

- **Domains**: explicit repo-to-domain mapping (Backend/Frontend/Infra/Firmware). Repos not listed use auto-detection from file extensions
- **Exclude repos**: skip specific repos from analysis
- **Production daily ref**: baseline for absolute Production scoring (default: 1000 changes/day = score 100)
- **Aliases**: merge variant git author names into canonical names
- **Exclude authors**: filter out bots and non-human contributors
- **Architecture patterns**: define which files count as "design files" for the Design axis. Defaults:
  - Backend: `*/repository/*interface*`, `*/domainservice/`, `*/router.go`, `*/middleware/`, `di/*.go`
  - Frontend: `*/core/`, `*/stores/`, `*/hooks/`, `*/types/`
  - Override in `eis.yaml` to match your project structure (e.g., `*/proto/`, `*/migrations/`, `Makefile`)
- **Blame extensions**: file extensions for blame analysis
- **Weights**: customize axis weights (default: Survival 25%, Design 20%, Production 15%, Debt 15%, Quality 10%, Breadth 10%, Indispensability 5%)
- **Survival tau**: decay half-life in days (default: 180)
- **Active days**: how recently an author must have committed to be marked active (default: 30)
- **Debt threshold**: minimum events for debt score (default: 10)

### What You Get

- **Rankings table** with all 7 axis scores, total, and **Active** indicator (✓ = committed within last 30 days)
- **3-axis topology** (Role / Style / State) with confidence scores (0.0-1.0) — e.g., `Architect (1.00) / Builder (0.86) / Active (0.80)`
- **Bus Factor risk map** showing modules with dangerous ownership concentration
- Color-coded output for quick visual scanning
- **JSON / CSV export** (`--format json|csv`) for dashboards and programmatic use

### Supported Languages

Works out of the box with: Go, TypeScript/JavaScript, Python, Rust, Java, Ruby, C/C++ (including firmware/embedded), Scala, Haskell, OCaml. Additional extensions can be added via `blame_extensions` in `eis.yaml`.

### Alternative: Claude Code

For deeper qualitative analysis (actionable insights, team recommendations), you can also use Claude Code:

```bash
claude "Follow the instructions in PROMPT.md to calculate Engineering Impact Scores for my team. Use config.yaml for configuration."
```
